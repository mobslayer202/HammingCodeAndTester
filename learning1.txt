std::cout and similar functions which dont require object creation are static

if you dont need data members use namespace instead of class?? - GPT

>>= on unsigned will be logical (bring in 0s)
>>= on signed will be arithmetic, depending on compiler (bring in copy of leftmost)
logical for << on unsigned; undefined behavior for << on signed - GPT
    - probably why 65536 shown on a short
    - changed the (& mask) to (<< 2) after changing values from short to unsigned short but still same problem
        - need to assign to unsigned short variable, doesnt work with expression only?
