hamming encoding only works with certain block sizes
    -(7,4) is most common but also (15,11) or (31,26)

array can only store 1 byte per index not 1 bit
    -wasteful to be used as param

Goal:
    encode and decode/correct data
    input files to be encoded and decoded


Implemenation:
    custom data structure for input?
        - data block for hamming
